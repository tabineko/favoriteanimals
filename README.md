# Rules

# My Project - (Favorite Motorcycle or Bicycle). 

Please help me with contributing of your favorite motorcycle or bicycle.

For example, write your favorite motorcycle that you would like to ride some day or you think it's just looking beautiful. For me it's "Honda CRF 250".
If you don't like  motorcycles write about bicycles.
If you don't like non of above, write "I like my feet more than wheels". LOL ))))
If you want you can add a link to the motorcycle/bicycle picture near the model name.

To do a contribution copy below "0." line and edit it to your favorite model (link isn't mandatory), then paste it to the last bottom line of this README file.
